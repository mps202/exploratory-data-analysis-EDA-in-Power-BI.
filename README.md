Assessing the Impact of Health and Lifestyle Factors on Hypertension Risk

Background:

Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a major public health concern that increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other serious conditions. It is often associated with various health and lifestyle factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, physical activity, and more. Understanding these factors is crucial for identifying individuals at risk and developing strategies to prevent and manage hypertension effectively. The dataset used in this analysis, sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prosperchuks/health-dataset), it contains a variety of health indicators, including age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and physical activity. An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted in Power BI to explore the relationships and patterns among these factors and their influence on the risk of hypertension.
