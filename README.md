Assessing the Impact of Lifestyle Choices on Diabetes Risk

Background:

Diabetes has become a significant public health concern, characterized by elevated blood sugar levels that can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Understanding the factors that contribute to diabetes risk is essential for effective prevention and management strategies. The dataset used in this analysis, sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prosperchuks/health-dataset), encompasses a range of health and lifestyle variables, including age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and physical activity levels.

Exploratory-data-analysis for the above project will be conducted in Power BI.
