Assessing the Impact of Health and Lifestyle Factors on Hypertension Risk

Background:

Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a major public health concern that increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other serious conditions. It is often associated with various health and lifestyle factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, physical activity, and more. Understanding these factors is crucial for identifying individuals at risk and developing strategies to prevent and manage hypertension effectively. The dataset used in this analysis, sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prosperchuks/health-dataset), it contains a variety of health indicators, including age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and physical activity. An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted in Power BI to explore the relationships and patterns among these factors and their influence on the risk of hypertension.



# Categorical Variables

Categorical variables represent discrete categories or groups. In your dataset, these are:

sex: Gender of the individual (binary: typically 0 for female, 1 for male).

cp: Chest pain type (typically categorical with different values representing different types).

fbs: Fasting blood sugar (binary: 0 or 1).

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (categorical with discrete values).

exang: Exercise induced angina (binary: 0 or 1).

slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (categorical with discrete values).

ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (categorical with discrete values).

thal: Thalassemia (categorical with discrete values).


# Numerical Variables

Numerical variables represent measurable quantities and can be either continuous or discrete. In your dataset, these are:

age: Age of the individual (continuous).

trestbps: Resting blood pressure (continuous).

chol: Serum cholesterol level (continuous).

oldpeak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest (continuous).

target: Presence or absence of heart disease (binary, but often treated as categorical for classification tasks).
